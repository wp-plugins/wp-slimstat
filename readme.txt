== Installation ==

1. Go to Plugins > Add New
2. Search for WP SlimStat
3. Click on Install Now under WP SlimStat
4. Make sure your template calls `wp_footer()` or the equivalent hook somewhere (possibly just before the `</body>` tag)
5. To customize all the plugin's options, go to Settings > Slimstat
6. If you moved your wp-config.php to a different location, or are blocking access to your wp-content folder, 
   please make sure to check the [FAQs](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-slimstat/faq/) to see if there's anything else you need to do

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I see a warning message saying that a misconfigured setting and/or server environment is preventing WP SlimStat from properly tracking my visitors =
WP SlimStat's tracking engine has a server-side component, which records all the information available at the time the resource is served,
and a client-side component, which collects extra data from your visitors' browsers, like their screen resolution, (x,y) coordinates of their
clicks and the events they trigger. 

One of the files responsible for taking care of this is `admin-ajax.php`, usually located inside your */wp-admin/* folder.
Point your browser to that file directly: if you see an error 404 or 500, then you will need to fix that problem, to allow WP SlimStat to do its job.
If you see the number zero, then you're fine.

= I am using W3 Total Cache/WP Super Cache, and it looks like your plugin is not tracking all of my visitors. Can you help me? =
Simply go to Settings > SlimStat and enable the option Javascript Mode. WP SlimStat will only track human visitors (just like Google Analytics does, pretty much), but its accuracy will dramatically improve.

= My screen goes blank when trying to access the reports / after installing WP SlimStat =
Try [to increase the amount of memory](http://codex.wordpress.org/Editing_wp-config.php#Increasing_memory_allocated_to_PHP) allocated to PHP. WP SlimStat requires about 5 Mb of RAM to track a pageview.

= When trying to access any of options screens, I get the following error: You do not have sufficient permissions to access this page. =
You were playing with the plugin's permission settings, weren't you? But don't worry, there's a secret passage that will allow you to unlock your access. Create a new user `slimstatadmin`, and assign him the Administrator role. Then log into your WordPress admin area with the new user and... voila: you can now access WP SlimStat's settings again. Update your users' permissions and then get rid of this newly created user.

= Why do I see discrepancies between Google Analytics, Jetpack Stats and Slimstat? =
Both Jetpack and GA use Javascript to track visitors. All the other pageviews are ignored, because search engines and other crawlers don't execute that client-side code.

WP SlimStat, on the other side, has a server-based tracking engine, which can capture *all* of your visitors, both 'humans' and 'bots'. That's the main reason why you may see more (some times much more) traffic recorded by WP SlimStat. 

= Can I track clicks and other events happening on the page? =
Yes, you can. This plugin includes a Javascript handler that can be attached to any event: click, mouseover, focus, keypress, etc. Here's the syntax:

`ss_track(e, c, n)`

Where:

* `e` is the event that was triggered (the word 'event' *must* be used when attaching event handlers to HTML tags, see examples below)
* `c` is a numeric value between 1 and 254 (zero is reserved for outbound clicks)
* `n` is a custom text (up to 512 chars long) that you can use to add a note to the event tracked. If the ID attribute is defined, and no note has been specified, the former will be recorded. If the function is attached to a key-related event, the key pressed will be recorded.

Examples:

* `onclick="if(typeof ss_track == 'function') ss_track(event, 5, 'clicked on first link');"`
* `onkeypress="if(typeof ss_track == 'function') ss_track(event, 20);"`
* To make your life easier, a *Google Plus One* callback function is included as well: `<g:plusone callback="slimstat_plusone"></g:plusone>`. Clicks on your Google+ button will be identified by the note 'google-plus-on/off'. Pleae refer to the [official documentation](https://developers.google.com/+/plugins/+1button/) for more information.

= How do I use all those filters in the dropdown menu? =
Here's a brief description of their meaning. Please remember that you can access the same information directly from within the admin, by 'pulling' the Help tab that should appear in the top right hand corner.

Basic filters:

* `browser`: user agent (Firefox, Chrome, ...)
* `country code`: 2-letter code (us, ru, de, it, ...)
* `referring domain`: domain name of the referrer page (i.e., www.google.com if a visitor was coming from Google)
* `ip`: visitor's public IP address
* `search terms`: keywords visitors used to find your website on a search engine
* `language code`: please refer to the [language culture names](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee825488(v=cs.20).aspx) (first column) for more information
* `operating system`: accepts identifiers like win7, win98, macosx, ...; please refer to [this manual page](http://php.net/manual/en/function.get-browser.php) for more information about these codes
* `permalink`: URL accessed on your site
* `referer`: complete URL of the referrer page
* `visitor's name`: visitor's name according to the cookie set by Wordpress after leaving a comment

Advanced filters:

* `browser capabilities`: plugins or extensions installed by that user (flash, java, silverlight...)
* `browser version`: user agent version (9.0, 11, ...)
* `browser type`: 1 = search engine crawler, 2 = mobile device, 3 = syndication reader, 0 = all others
* `color depth`: visitor's screen's color depth (8, 16, 24, ...)
* `css version`: what CSS standard was supported by that browser (1, 2, 3 and other integer values)
* `pageview attributes`: this field is set to [pre] if the resource has been accessed through Link Prefetching or similar techniques
* `post author`: author associated to that post/page when the resource was accessed
* `post category id`: ID of the category/term associated to the resource, when available
* `private ip`: visitor's private IP address, if available
* `resource content type`: post, page, cpt:*custom-post-type*, attachment, singular, post_type_archive, tag, taxonomy, category, date, author, archive, search, feed, home; please refer to the [Conditional Tags](http://codex.wordpress.org/Conditional_Tags) manual page for more information
* `screen resolution`: viewport width and height (1024x768, 800x600, ...)
* `visit id`: generally used in conjunction with 'is not empty', identifies human visitors

= How do I create my own custom reports? =
You will need to embed them in a plugin that leverages WP SlimStat APIs to retrieve the data. You can also access WP SlimStat's tables directly, for more complicated stuff.
Please refer to the database description and API reference guide here below for more information on what tables/methods are available.

Let's say you came up with your own SQL query, something like

`SELECT resource, COUNT(*) countresults
FROM $this->table_stats
WHERE resource <> ''
GROUP BY resource
ORDER BY countresults DESC
LIMIT 0,20`

Just write a function that gets the results and displays them, making sure to use the same HTML mark-up shown in the example here below:

`public function my_cystom_report() {
	$sql = "SELECT ...";
	$results = $wpdb->get_results($sql, ARRAY_A);

	// Boxes come in three sizes: wide, medium, normal (default).
	wp_slimstat_boxes:box_header('my_custom_box_id', 'My Custom Box Inline Help', 'medium', false, '', 'My cool report');

	foreach($results as $a_result){
		echo "<p>{$a_result['resource']} <span>{$a_result['countresults']}</span></p>";
	}
	
	wp_slimstat_boxes:box_footer(); // closes the DIV's open by box_header
}`

Then let WP SlimStat know about it:

`add_action('wp_slimstat_custom_report', 'my_cystom_report');`

Save your file as `my_custom_report.php` and then [follow these instructions](http://codex.wordpress.org/Writing_a_Plugin#Standard_Plugin_Information) on how to make a plugin out of that file.

= Can I disable outbound link tracking on a given link? =
Yes, you can. This is useful if you notice that, after clicking on a Lightbox-powered thumbnail, the image doesn't open inside the popup window as expected.
Let's say you have a link associated to Lightbox (or one of its clones):

`<a href="/wp-slimstat">Open Image in LightBox</a>`

Change it to:

`<a href="/wp-slimstat" class="noslimstat">Open Image in LightBox</a>`

You can also use the corresponding setting in the Options > Advanced page to disable outbound link tracking for *all* the external links in your site.

= Why does WP SlimStat show more page views than actual pages clicked by a user? =
"Phantom" page views can occur when a user's browser does automatic feed retrieval,
[link pre-fetching](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Link_prefetching_FAQ), or a page refresh. WP SlimStat tracks these because they are valid
requests from that user's browser and are indistinguishable from user link clicks. You can ignore these visits setting the corresponding option
in Settings > SlimStat > Filters

= Why can't WP SlimStat track visitors using IPv6? =
IPv6 support, as of today, is still really limited both in PHP and MySQL. There are a few workarounds that could be implemented, but this
would make the DB structure less optimized, add overhead for tracking regular requests, and you would have a half-baked product.

= How do I stop WP SlimStat from tracking spammers? =
Go to Settings > SlimStat > Filters and set "Ignore Spammers" to YES.

= How do I stop WP SlimStat from recording new visits on my site? =
Go to Settings > SlimStat > General and set "Activate tracking" to NO.

= Can I add/show reports on my website? =
Yes, you can. WP SlimStat offers two ways of displaying its reports on your website.

*Via shortcodes*

Please download and install [WP SlimStat Shortcodes](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-slimstat-shortcodes/) to enable shortcode support in WP SlimStat.

*Using the API*

You will need to edit your template and add something like this where you want your metrics to appear:

`// Load WP SlimStat DB, the API library exposing all the reports
require_once(WP_PLUGIN_DIR.'/wp-slimstat/admin/view/wp-slimstat-db.php');

// Initialize the API. You can pass a filter in the options, i.e. show only hits by people who where using Firefox, any version
wp_slimstat_db::init('browser contains Firefox');

// Use the appropriate method to display your stats
echo wp_slimstat_db::count_records('1=1', '*', false);`

*Available methods*

* `count_records($where_clause = '1=1', $column = '*', $use_filters = true, $use_date_filters = true)` - returns the number of records matching your criteria
 * **$where_clause** is the one used in the SQL query
 * **$column**, if specified, will count DISTINCT values
 * **$use_filters** can be true or false, it enables or disables previously set filters (useful to count ALL the records in the database, since by default a filter for the current month is enabled)
 * **$use_date_filters** can be set to false to count ALL the pageviews from the beginning of time
* `count_bouncing_pages()` - returns the number of [pages that 'bounce'](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bounce_rate#Definition)
* `count_exit_pages()` - returns the number of [exit pages](http://support.google.com/analytics/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=2525491)
* `get_recent($column = 'id', $custom_where = '', $join_tables = '', $having_clause = '')` - returns recent results matching your criteria
 * **$column** is the column you want group results by
 * **$custom_where** can be used to replace the default WHERE clause
 * **$join_tables** by default, this method return all the columns of wp_slim_stats; if you need to access (join) other tables, use this param to list them: `tb.*, tss.*, tci.*`
 * **$having_clause** can be used to further filter results based on aggregate functions
* `get_popular($column = 'id', $custom_where = '', $join_tables = '')`
 * **$column** is the column you want group results by
 * **$custom_where** can be used to replace the default WHERE clause
 * **$_more_columns** to 'group by' more than one column and return the corresponding rows

*Examples*

= I noticed that the file `view.css` contains numerous base64 encoded strings, which I find kind of alarming. Is this normal? =

I'm particularly serious when it comes to data integrity and safety, and I always try to put the best of my knowledge to make sure WP SlimStat is secure and doesn't carry any vulnerability.
What you found in the CSS is a common technique used by experienced web developers to optimize site performances by 'embedding' small images (mainly icons)
directly into the CSS, thus avoiding extra requests to the server to download all the media elements referenced by the page.
You can get more information about this technique on [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_URI_scheme).

* [Thomas Nielsen](http://www.bogt.dk/), for his generous donation and for helping with the new icon set.

== Database usage ==
WP SlimStat uses its own tables in order to maintain the complex information about visits, visitors, browsers and Countries. It adds 2 new tables for each blog, plus 4 shared tables (6 tables in total, for a single-user installation). Please keep this in mind before activating WP SlimStat on large networks of blogs.

== Dashboard Widgets == 
After you download and install WP SlimStat, you'll see not one, but two new plugins in your administration panel.
Don't worry, you just need to activate the first one in order to track your visitors. WP SlimStat Dashboard Widgets
adds some reports directly to your dashboard.
